# Wrangling and analysis of the WERATEDOGS twitter dataset  

## By Mbang Ernest N.  

## Introduction  

This data that was wrangled, analyzed and visualized is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. They believe the dogs are amaxing and warrant such amazing ratings that is why we joined them to share in thier amazement.

# Overview  
For this analysis, we connected to the twitter api using tweepy libarrr. We further got other datasets programmatically using pythons requests library and we had an archive dataset readily available which was used alongside the analysis. The html reports(act_report and wrangle_report) further explain our rational. The notebookfile is also self explanatory.
